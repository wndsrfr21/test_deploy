I don’t like being sad and I don’t like talking about being sad. But I’m learning that it’s okay to feel sad sometimes. I’m learning that sadness is simply a part of reality that must be embodied and endured. I’m still a happy person, well at least I hope I will be tomorrow. And I hope I’ll accept what I can change and what I cannot. And I’ll try not to forget to remember all the things that I’m grateful for; the things that make me happy. But in this moment, I’m sad. And in this moment, maybe that’s perfectly okay.
